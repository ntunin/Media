## Using
### Create MediaCoordinator

First create object `MediaCoordinator`

```Swift
private var coordinator: MediaCoordinator?
```

`MediaCoordinator` initialization:

```Swift
MediaCoordinator(navigationViewController: UINavigationController, mediaAppearance: MediaAppearance, filter: MediaItemsFilter)
```

Let's break it down for you one at a time:
- `navigationViewController: UINavigationController` need for navigation. 
- `mediaAppearance: MediaAppearance` object for customization UI on gallery. Argument is optional.
- `filter: MediaItemsFilter` enum for filtered item in gallery. Default value `.all`.

Also `MediaCoordinator` is have important variable such as:

```Swift

```

After init class `MediaCoordinator` and call `func start()` on coordinator

```Swift
    private func start() {
        coordinator = .init(navigationViewController: navigationController)
        coordinator?.delegate = self
        coordinator?.start()
    }
```

## Requirements

- iOS 12.2+
- Xcode 12.0+

## Installation

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks. To integrate MediaService into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "rosberry/Media"
```
### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate MediaService into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'Media'
```

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler. Once you have your Swift package set up, adding MediaService as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/rosberry/Media.git")
]
```
